# byteverse_Smart_Contractors
This is the voting system based on blockchain.
* Government spends crores of rupees in securing and transporting EVMs and huge amounts of money on resources and security at every poll booth.
* We, as smart contractors are here with the solution to this problem.
* A voting system based on blockchain technology is a decentralized and secure way to conduct elections. 
* It uses a distributed ledger to record and verifies the votes cast by individuals.
* It uses smart contracts on blockchain for security and a user-friendly web environment for end-user interaction.
* Smart Contracts will be made for the voting system.
Different contracts will be made for different elections. For example, for the election of the Central Government of India and the State election of Bihar, the contracts will be different.
* The contracts will contain the function or modifiers which are responsible for:
    1. **Registration**: Generating hex address for new user.
    2. **Verification**: Verifies the identity and whether the user has given his vote or not
    3. **Counting**: Counts the number of votes given to the particular party.
    4. **Declaration** of result: Declares the result as soon as the time is over.


## Dependencies used in the project

* Wallet is required to deploy the contract of the voting.
