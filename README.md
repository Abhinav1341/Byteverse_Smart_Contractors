# byteverse_Smart_Contractors
This is the voting system based on blockchain.
* Government spends crores of rupees in securing and transporting EVMs and huge amounts of money on resources and security at every poll booth.
* We, as smart contractors are here with the solution to this problem.
* A voting system based on blockchain technology is a decentralized and secure way to conduct elections. 
* It uses a distributed ledger to record and verifies the votes cast by individuals.
* It uses smart contracts on blockchain for security and a user-friendly web environment for end-user interaction.
* Smart Contracts will be made for the voting system.
Different contracts will be made for different elections. For example, for the election of the Central Government of India and the State election of Bihar, the contracts will be different.
* The contracts will contain the function or modifiers which are responsible for:
    1. **Registration**: Generating hex address for new user.
    2. **Verification**: Verifies the identity and whether the user has given his vote or not
    3. **Counting**: Counts the number of votes given to the particular party.
    4. **Declaration** of result: Declares the result as soon as the time is over.

## Dependencies used in the project


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
